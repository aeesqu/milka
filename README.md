# Milka
Milka is a 2d game engine written in c++.

# Platforms
For now, windows is the only supported platform.
I will add support to other platforms as soon as I get
a better computer :)

# Rendering APIs
Milka support multiple rendering apis.
For now, the supported rendering APIs are:
-DirectX9
-SDL2 renderer

For now, I can't add OpenGL since my computer only supports
OpenGL 1.1.
